DivHacks 2024: Tech for Social Good

Start and end dates of your event: October 5 to October 6, 2024
University name/organization name: Columbia University Women in Computer Science
Country, state or province, city: New York City, NY, USA


Event Summary

What made your hackathon special or unique?
DivHacks, Columbia University and Barnard College’s official diversity hackathon, encouraged individuals from many different experience levels in technology to attend, but approximately 60% of our hackers identify as being beginner hackers (as collected from our registration statistics). We cater our hackathons to underclassmen especially (i.e. incoming freshmen at Columbia, Barnard, and other universities) because DivHacks offers a collaborative, judgement-free space with mentors for hackers learning about emerging technologies, their applications in society, and if they can see themselves pursuing technology in the long-term (as well as engaging with Columbia’s strong computer science community). To emphasize, we will have mentors from industry and academia in Columbia’s graduate schools from the greater NYC area to assist our beginner hackers. Our workshops mainly focus on teaching hackers how to use new technologies they may be unfamiliar with (i.e. GitHub, AR/VR, Web3, etc.), and most hackers leave DivHacks having learned how to use a new form of technology/incorporate it into their project by the end of the hackathon.. Additionally, most of our corporate sponsors are sending mentors to demo their technologies/help answer technical questions about their tech. products, knowing DivHacks has a large beginner hacker population. As for tracks, we focused on social betterment through technology in diverse social sectors of health, fashion, education, etc. to cater to all of our hacker’s interests.

Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on.
DivHacks offered many opportunities for hackers to have recreational time but also network and develop their technical skills. During our opening ceremony, hackers met Dr. Rebecca Wright, the Chair of Computer Science at Barnard College and frontier privacy, security, and education researcher, as well as Yasin Eshan, thirteen-time hackathon winner, ex-Capital One SWE, and founder of Heastarter AI, who offered to do resume reviews for hackers. Our workshops included our sponsor Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative’s patient safety tech. challenge track workshop, MLH GitHub Copilot workshop, our sponsor Snap AR’s Snapchat AR product launch/demo, our introduction to Git workshop, our sponsor Google’s Breadboard API demo, and our sponsor SWSH’s “How to Build a Million-Dollar Start-Up.” We also organized a sponsor career fair for Google Labs, BlackRock, Capital One, etc. that almost all hackers attended and dropped their resumes off at as well as a “Meet the Judges” panel the day before judging. For fun, we hosted a LinkedIn speed dating activity, our annual Jane Street Estimathon, and a spicy ramen night and caffeine hall from our sponsor Red Bull for our overnight hackers.

How was GitHub featured at your event (include pictures)?
DivHacks made multiple efforts to incorporate GitHub into our hackathon events and activities. We opted for the MLH GitHub workshop in our preferences, “Making Better Hacks, Faster with GitHub Copilot,” which our MLH coach, Gabriella Miesner, hosted. Additionally, one of the veteran teaching assistants (TAs) of Columbia University’s core computer science classes, advanced programming in C (COMS W3157) and operating systems (COMS W4118), lead a workshop on how to navigate GitHub in efforts of encouraging hackers to save their projects in GitHub repositories/using Git as a version control system to track changes in project source code.

Impact of GitHub Grant

How did you use the grant funds?
Below are ways the grant funds were allocated for DivHacks. Note: ultimately, the final grant allocations will be determined by DivHacks’ governing body, Columbia Women in Computer Science, and its secretaries/executive board.
AV fees for our primary venue and hackerspace, Roone Arledge Auditorium in Lerner Hall (this includes microphone and projector use, hacker and sponsor table set-up and clean-up)
Set-up fees for Lerner Hall rooms used for workshops, storage, and career fair (Lerner 555, Lerner-Satow, Broadway room, etc.)
Overnight venue fees for Carleton Commons, Mudd Building
Public safety/security for Roone Auditorium and Carleton Commons
Rented moving bins from Columbia Housing
Catering and refreshments for hackers: pizza, Indian food, ramen, oatmeal, breakfast from Columbia Dining (JJ’s Place)

How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants?
The funds allowed DivHacks to have interactive presentations from sponsors and workshop leaders throughout Lerner Hall, ensure we secured the largest space on campus for our three hundred hackers to work comfortably, and cater enough food and refreshments for them for over thirty-six hours. Most importantly, with the campus lockdown situation at Columbia, the funds allowed us to meet safety requirements put in place by University Student Life (such as affording public safety officers) to be able to host DivHacks on our campus. Depending on allocations by Columbia Women in Computer Science, these funds may also be used for reimbursements of prize purchases, which were shared with Columbia Computer Science Department’s offered funding for DivHacks.

What’s Next?

Include a high-level wrap-up summary.
Despite campus access restrictions and difficulties, DivHacks was successful on campus. Hackers were resilient and satisfied with the hackathon, and we welcomed many beginners who are just starting their hackathon journeys. With support from our MLH coach and MLH advisors, our welcoming sponsors, and our expert judges, hackers expressed that they were impressed at the networking opportunities DivHacks offered in addition to challenging their technical prowess. Additionally, our BUIDL page of projects is full of hacks that are aimed at bettering society in education, environment, media, fashion, civic tech., and health, teams and ideas that will continue past the hackathon into actual applications and businesses (based on the feedback we’ve received from hackers). Thank you to the GitHub Education grant for making this possible!

What are the dates of your future hackathon?
Tentatively, DivHacks 2025 will be Saturday, October 20 to Sunday, October 21, 2025.
