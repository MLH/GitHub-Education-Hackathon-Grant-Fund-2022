# WiNGHacks
WiNGHacks is a 36 hour event in collaboration with MLH starting on Friday, April 5th and ending Sunday, April 7th. It will be hosted in-person at the Herbert Wertheim Building at the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL.

## Event Summary

- What made your hackathon special or unique? <br> WiNGHacks is an amazing opportunity for you to engage with talented female and non-binary students, raise brand awareness, and test out your technologies. We offer many ways to interact and show your support! According to MLH, only 27% of hackathon participants are women or people of gender minorities, demonstrating a need to increase representation and access to a space that is predominantly male. Hearing the need of our community, we wanted to create an inviting environment for genders historically underrepresented in tech, especially those who are first-time hackers, to unlock the many benefits that a hackathon brings. Students will have the opportunity to develop a project of their own from start to finish, network with companies and fellow hackers, and present their project to judges and sponsors.
- Tell us about some of the cool features, mini-events, or workshops that your organizers put on. <br>  Some mini-events included social such as a cookie decorating social and a plethora of workshops to teach hackers new skills.
- How was **GitHub** featured at your event? <br> It was used by the hackers to work on their projects as well as for submission.
