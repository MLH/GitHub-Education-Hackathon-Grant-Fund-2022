# HackRPI 2024
 - 11th Annual Hackathon
 - Nov. 9th - Nov 10th, 2024
 - Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute
 - Troy, NY, USA

## Event Summary
 
- Our theme for this year was Urban Upgrades, and much of our event was based around that
- Our most unique prize track was best Quantum Computing Hack, alongisde tours of RPI's quantum computer throughout the event
- We also had Quantum Cybersecurity and Quantum Algorithm Dev workshops
- We had a total of 15 Workshops at the hackathon overall, including chats with company sponsors, fun evens like sticker making, and tech stack guides
- Github was included and taught at the first workshop of the day, as an essential part of our recommended tech stack
- This year we also worked with MLH to host a TechTogether meetup for our first ever time, allowing underrepresented genders in technology to meetup and talk about their experiences. Our participants thoroughly enjoyed it, and we look forward to continuing to host these meetups in our future events

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- We used the Github Grant funding to make sure we had enough money to run the event. We were able to have enough money to run the midnight Bubble Tea event just like last year, which was a huge success once again. Just like last year, we don't earmark funds for specific things, and so these funds also helped with things like food, stickers, shirts, and more.

## Top Projects

- Our first place project, [WALKR](https://devpost.com/software/walkr-kalje2), used GPS and spatial mapping to navigate using AR, projecting a route for users to follow without having to check their phones, and offering integrations like providing wheelchair accessible routes
- Another project, [EcoVision](https://devpost.com/software/recircle-ot57su), built an app for users to upload images of items around them, giving tips for how they can be repurposed or recycled, or can be used on video in something like a waste management facility to boost recycling efficiency
